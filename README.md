# Ursula

A slim framework to make Scala CLI apps in ZIO.

## Project Status

This project is still in (very) early development, but feel free to give it a
try - I'd love to hear any feedback you have. I had been publishing early artifacts to CloudSmith,
but I'll be updating to Maven Central soon.

## Cross Compatibility

This project was steering towards a focus on Scala Native, however I think I painted myself into a corner with that.
Now, this project is going to focus on just the JVM, and Scala 3. It's also going to be very scala-cli focused.

## Anatomy of the Framework

Here is a general overview if of the pieces fit together.

### How it works: UrsulaApp

You only need to make an object that extends the `UrsulaApp` trait, and provide
a `Seq[Command]`, which are your actions you wish to be available in your
app. `UrsulaApp` extends `ZIOAppDefault`, and wires up everything needed for the
`run` method automatically! It parses the arguments passed, and uses that to
pull out the `Command` provided, and runs accordingly, passing on the arguments
to it.

There are some [built in commands](#built-in-commands) provided, such as the
`HelpCommand` and `ConfigCommand`, that are also automatically injected. This
means that even if you only have:

```scala
object App extends UrsulaApp {
  override val commands: Seq[Command] = Seq.empty
}
```

you already have a functioning cli app that has a `help` command that prints all
the available commands accepted (as little as they are so far), as well as a
`config` command that will let a user set/get/delete values from the apps config
file (defaulted to `$home/.ursula/config.json`)

At this point, you need only implement some `Command`s that wrap the
functionality you desire, and add them to the `commands: Seq`.

### Commands

There is a `trait Command` to extend, and the essence of this the
implementation of

```scala
def action(args: Chunk[String]): ZIO[UrsulaServices, Throwable, ?]
```

You consolidate all of your ZIO logic you want to run in this method that will
pass in arguments that are `Chunk[String]` and returns a
`ZIO[UrsulaServices, Throwable, ?]`. Note that the return value is `?` - the
actual result is discarded to `.unit`, as `Commands` are meant to be a
one-off calls from the main entry point, and generally not composed with
other `Command`s.

`UrsulaServices` are a collection of built in ZIO services that are available
for you to use (or not at all, if you don't want to!). `UrsulaServices` are
bundled in via the `UrsulaApp`, so you don't need to provide them with your
logic - you just need to provide all of the other resources to run your won
logic (i.e. you can `.provideSome[UrsulaServices](...yourDepsHere))` and not
have to worry about it.

There are a few other items to implement, such as

```scala
  val trigger: String
val description: String
val usage: String
val examples: Seq[String]
```

`trigger` is the String that should be used at the start of your CLI arguments
to call that particular command. The others are simple informational strings
about your command - and those are automatically used by the built-in help
command to print documentation!

Two other important things to declare are

```scala
  val flags: Seq[Flag[?]]
val arguments: Seq[Argument[?]]
```

[Flags](#flags) and [Arguments](#arguments) are discussed below, but know that
they are simple traits to extend that help you parse/provide values for the
`args` passed in - and they too have some simple Strings to implement that
provide auto documentation for your app. At the end of the day, you can just
parse the `args` on your own in your ZIO logic - but usage of the `Flag`s
and`Arguments` should hopefully simplify things for your and your apps users.

#### Built-In Commands

- HelpCommand - handles the printing of documentation
- ConfigCommand - manipulates a simple JSON config file

### Flags

Flags (`trait Flag[R]`) are non-positional arguments passed to the command.
Flags can be generally used as either an argument flag, which expects the next
element in the command arguments to be parsed as type `R`, or boolean flags
which do not (i.e. present/not present).

The
[source code](ursula/shared/src/main/scala/com/alterationx10/ursula/args/Flag.scala)
is fairly well documented at this point. Some general highlights are that it has
things built in to

- parse argument(s) that can then be used in you `Command`
- declare conflicts with other flags
- declare requirements of other flags
- provide defaults, of ENV variables to be used

### Arguments

Arguments (`trait Argument[R]`) are _positional_ arguments passed to the
command, and are to be parsed to type `R`

The
[source code](ursula/shared/src/main/scala/com/alterationx10/ursula/args/Argument.scala)
is fairly well documented at this point. Some general highlights are that you
can encode the parsing logic.

### Built-In Services

`UrsulaServices` is the sum of all services that are automatically provided in
the `R` channel of your commands `action` zio. See below for more info on each.

#### CliConfig

This service allows you to get/set/delete keys from the apps config file. Behind
the scenes, the `UrsulaApp` will automatically read the config file at start,
and load it into an in memory `Map`. This `Map` is what backs this service, and
if the state becomes dirty (i.e. a `set` or `delete` is used), then after your
`Command` logic has run, it will persist the `Map` back to disk.

## Using in your project

As mentioned above, I'll be moving artifacts to maven central soon, so check back for soon artifacts/versions.

## Other Projects

It's always good to have options ðŸ˜‰.

There is an official [zio-cli](https://github.com/zio/zio-cli) project out
there, and I encourage you to check that out too! I feel maybe one large
difference is just how apps are structured/built, driven mostly by my
motivations outlined [above](#about). A lot of my inspiration for this project
comes from [oclif: Node.JS Open CLI Framework ](https://github.com/oclif/oclif).
